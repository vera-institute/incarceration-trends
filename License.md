Vera has developed and owns the Dataset, a collection of jail population and prison statistics that contains 47 years (1970-2017) of data for each of the approximately 3,000 counties that use a county jail (see the Dataset Github page for complete detail on the source datasets at https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends). The Dataset was compiled by Vera staff using publicly available BJS data sourced through ICPSR. Vera is willing to grant Recipient access to the Dataset on the following terms:

## 2. Non-dissemination and Assurances

## 3. Indemnity
Recipient shall defend, indemnify, release, and hold Vera harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses arising out of their use of or access to the Dataset, including, without limitation, those arising from Recipient’s negligence or breach of any of the terms of this Agreement. This provision will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

## 4. Miscellaneous
The Dataset is provided “as is.” Vera disclaims any and all warranties of any kind with respect to the Dataset, and the Recipient hereby releases Vera and waives any and all claims it may have against Vera in connection with Recipient’s use of the Dataset. Neither party may assign its rights under this Agreement without the express written permission of the other party. This Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. New York law will govern this Agreement and the New York courts will have jurisdiction over disputes arising hereunder.
